# Robot Structure Program - C

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the use of structures to represent a robot with a name and battery level.

## Explanation:
1. Structure Definition:
- The program defines a `struct` named `Robot` that has two members:
    - `char name[20]`: An array of characters to store the robot's name.
    - `int batteryLevel`: An integer to store the robot's battery level as a percentage.
2. Main Function:
- A variable `robo1` of type `struct Robot` is created and initialized with the name `"Robo1"` and a battery level of `100%`.
- The program then prints the robot's name and battery level to the console.
