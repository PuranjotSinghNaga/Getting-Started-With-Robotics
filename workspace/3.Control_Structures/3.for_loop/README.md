# Iteration Program - C

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the use of a `for` loop to iterate a fixed number of times.

## Explanation:
The `for` loop runs 5 times, with the loop variable `i` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration.
The condition `i < 5` ensures that the loop continues as long as `i` is less than 5.
During each iteration, the current value of `i` is printed.
