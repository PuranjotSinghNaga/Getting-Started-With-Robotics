# Hello, World! - C Program
This repository contains a simple C program that outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the console. This is often the first program beginners write when learning a new programming language, as it introduces basic concepts such as syntax, structure, and the process of compiling and executing code.

## Code Explanation
1. `#include <stdio.h>`
This line is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the Standard Input Output library (`stdio.h`) in the program. This library contains functions for performing input and output operations, such as `printf`, which is used to print text to the console.

2. `int main()`
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. When the program is executed, the code inside the main function is run first. The `int` before `main` indicates that the function returns an integer value.

3. `{ ... }`
The curly braces `{` and `}` define the beginning and end of the `main` function's body. All the code inside these braces is what gets executed when the program runs.

4. `printf("Hello, World!\n");`
The `printf` function is used to output text to the console. In this case, it prints the string `"Hello, World!"` followed by a newline character `\n`, which moves the cursor to the next line after printing the text. The semicolon `;` at the end of the line indicates the end of this statement.

5. `return 0;`
The `return` statement is used to exit the `main` function and return a value to the operating system. Returning `0` typically indicates that the program completed successfully. This is a convention in C programming, where a return value of `0` means the program executed without errors.
