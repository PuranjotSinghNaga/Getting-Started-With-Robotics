# Robot Simulation Program - C

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the use of structures to represent a robot with a name and Speed and Position, and update the position with respect to time.

## Explanation:
1. Update Function: The `update_robot_state` function now takes a `Robot` struct by value (instead of using a pointer). It updates the robot's position and returns the updated Robot.

2. Main Function: The `myRobot` instance is updated by assigning it the value returned by `update_robot_state` after each time interval.
