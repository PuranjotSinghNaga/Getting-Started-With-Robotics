# Addition Function Program - C

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the use of functions by adding two integers and printing the result.

## Explanation:
1. `Function Declaration:` The function `add` is declared at the beginning of the program with a signature `int add(int a, int b);`. This informs the compiler that a function named add will be used and that it takes two integer arguments and returns an integer.
2. `Main Function:` The `main` function calls the `add` function with arguments `5` and `10`, stores the result in the `sum` variable, and then prints the result.
3. `Function Definition:` The `add` function is defined after the `main` function. It takes two integers `a` and `b`, adds them together, and returns the result.
