# Age, Height, and Grade - C Program

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the use of basic data types and the `printf` function to output values in C. The program stores a person's age, height, and grade, then prints these values to the console.

## Code Explanation

1. `int age = 21;`
This line declares an integer variable named `age` and initializes it with the value `21`.

2. `float height = 5.9;`
This line declares a floating-point variable named `height` and initializes it with the value `5.9`.

3. `char grade = 'A';`
This line declares a character variable named `grade` and initializes it with the value `'A'`.

4. `printf("Age: %d\n", age);`
This line uses the `printf` function to print the value of the `age` variable to the console. The %d format specifier is used for printing an integer.

5. `printf("Height: %.1f\n", height);`
This line uses the `printf` function to print the value of the `height` variable to the console. The `%.1f` format specifier is used for printing a floating-point number with one digit after the decimal point.

6. `printf("Grade: %c\n", grade);`
This line uses the printf function to print the value of the `grade` variable to the console. The %c format specifier is used for printing a character.
