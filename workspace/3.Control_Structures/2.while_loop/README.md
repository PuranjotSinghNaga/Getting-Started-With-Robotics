# Countdown Program - C

This repository contains a simple C program that performs a countdown from 10 to 1 and then prints `"Liftoff!"`.

## Explanation:

The while loop continues to run as long as the count variable is greater than 0.
Each iteration prints the current value of count and then decrements it by 1.
Once the countdown reaches 0, the loop exits, and the program prints `"Liftoff!"`.
