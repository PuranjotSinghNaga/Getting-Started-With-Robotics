# Grading System - C Program

This repository contains a simple C program that determines a student's grade based on their score.

## Code Explanation

1. `Conditional Statements:` The program uses an if-else if-else structure to determine the grade:

- `Grade A` for scores 90 and above.
- `Grade B` for scores 80 to 89.
- `Grade C` for scores below 80.
  2 `Score:` In this example, the score is set to 75, so the program will output Grade: C.
