# Array Iteration Program - C

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates how to iterate over an array and print its elements.

## Explanation:
1. `Array Declaration:`The program defines an integer array `numbers` with 5 elements: `10, 20, 30, 40, 50`.
2. For Loop: 
- The `for` loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` array. 
- The loop variable `i` runs from 0 to 4, corresponding to the indices of the array elements.
- During each iteration, the program prints the index and the value of the corresponding array element.
